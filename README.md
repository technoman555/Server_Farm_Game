# Server Farm

**Build. Cool. Expand. Repeat.**

Hello all and welcome to **Server Farm** — a game about (go figure) building and managing server farms / data centers!

(The cooler name "Data Center" was sadly already taken...)

## Why This Project Exists

This is a **100% public, MIT-licensed** passion project.

- Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute  
- All pull requests will be reviewed and voted on  
- No corporate BS, no monetization plans, no pressure  

I'm making this game because it scratches that **home-lab, rack-mounting, blinking-LEDs, cable-management, server-rack-nerd** itch in my brain. If that sounds like you too — welcome aboard! 😄

I just want a fun game to play. If others enjoy building it together, even better.

Everything is public. Be kind, be helpful, and let's learn together. Most of us (myself included) are probably going to mess up a bunch along the way — and that's okay.

## Goals

- Create a satisfying idle / management / tycoon-style game focused on building out increasingly ridiculous server farms
- Nail the aesthetic and feeling of real-world home labs, small colo setups, growing to hyperscale data centers
- Include fun nerd references (old hardware, RAID jokes, cooling horror stories, power bill panic, etc.)
- Make something we all actually want to play ourselves
- Learn a ton about game development along the way (especially in Godot!)
- Build a kind, collaborative, low-ego open-source game dev community around it

No pressure to ship fast — this is a long-term fun project.

## Current Status

**Extremely early development** — basically pre-pre-pre-alpha.

- Concept stage
- Core gameplay loop still being designed
- No releases yet
- No assets, no builds, no real gameplay to show

Right now it's mostly notes, ideas, bad sketches, and excitement.

## Tech Stack

- Engine: **Godot** (100% of development will happen in Godot)
- Language: GDScript (primary), maybe some C# later if needed
- License: MIT (do whatever you want with the code — just keep it friendly)

## Questions for Anyone Interested

(Feel free to answer these in Discussions or on pull requests/comments!)

- What kind of server-farm / homelab / data-center things do you want to see in the game?
- Should power, heat, noise, cabling, and uptime be core mechanics?
- Favorite real-world server horror stories or memes we should reference?
- Any hardware / brands / old tech you want immortalized in-game?
- What would make you open the game and smile?

Let's build something dumb and awesome together.

Happy rack-mounting!
